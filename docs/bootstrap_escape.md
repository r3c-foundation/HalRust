### — The Bootstrap Protocol for Compiler Freedom

## ⚙️ Step 1 — Pick Any Rust

Choose **any version** of Rust you trust — stable, nightly, or even legacy.  
HalRust doesn’t care which LLVM build it came from.  
All that matters is: you can compile it *once.*

```bash
rustup default 1.79.0
````

> 💡 The goal: capture the compiler, not obey it.

---

## ⚙️ Step 2 — Translate Rust into R3C

Use **HalRust** to translate LLVM-based Rust output
into pure ASM or R3C-compatible IR.

```bash
halrust build --mode asm src/main.rs
```

Now your code no longer depends on LLVM passes.
It’s clean, deterministic, and reproducible — ready for freedom.

## ⚙️ Step 3 — Bootstrap through R3C

Feed the translated output into the **R3C Core Compiler**
to rebuild itself — a true self-hosting, LLVM-free toolchain.

```bash
r3c bootstrap halrust
```

This final step **recreates the compiler** from its own translated form.
Once this loop closes, you’ve achieved **compiler sovereignty.**

## 🧠 Summary

| Phase | Action                | Result                               |
| ----- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ①     | Pick any Rust version | LLVM no longer controls the timeline |
| ②     | Translate via HalRust | Language independence achieved       |
| ③     | Bootstrap in R3C      | Complete self-hosting freedom        |
